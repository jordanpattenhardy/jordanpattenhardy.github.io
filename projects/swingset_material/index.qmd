## Project Overview

For this project, I needed to select a material for a swingset crossbeam. I modeled a swing set crossbeam as a simply supported beam under a center load to identify the materials that met a maximum deflection limit of 0.5 mm. I compared several materials for stiffness, weight, cost, and durability, then created a graph and table in Excel to visualize performance and determine the optimal material under given the design constraints.
