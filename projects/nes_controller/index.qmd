## Project Details

* The controller was modeled using engineering drawings drawn by C.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Mattson.
* CAD operations used in the completion of this project include lofts, revolves, sweeps, and patterns.
* I modeled many of the parts, including the Start/Select Buttons, the A/B Buttons, the D-Pad, the Top and Bottom covers (with supports and rib bosses) and the PCB. Other parts, such as the charging cord, were provided as part of the project.
