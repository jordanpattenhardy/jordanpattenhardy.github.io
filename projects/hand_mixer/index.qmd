* Most parts in the assembly were created using a master model and offset surfaces. The body of the master model was created with a revolve, while the handle was formed using a complex loft that follows a guide curve. 



### Testing and Documentation

##### Tests

Many tests were run during the modeling process to make sure that a desirable result was being created. These tests were used to determine whether the interferences that occurred were expected, whether the model had a constant wall thickness so it could be constructed with injection modeling, and whether the model had a constant curvature in the intended areas.
