## Project Overview

This project aimed to modernize an existing design by enhancing its appearance and implementing mechanical improvements for better functionality.

## The Process
As part of a four-person team tasked with improving an engine design, I proposed and implemented modifications to enhance the manufacturability of a pneumatic engine assembly. We developed detailed process sheets for each component, specifying appropriate tooling and machining operations, and manufactured components using a range of techniques including CNC milling, manual turning, sand casting, and powder metallurgy.

Once all we had manufactured all the components, the engine was fully assembled and tested. As a result of our team’s design modifications, the engine operated at a lower PSI than any of the other team’s engines built from the same initial design and specifications. Afterwards, we compiled a prototyping package, including detailed engineering drawings and process sheets for each part.

We also compiled a comprehensive design report, which included documentation of implemented design changes and recommendations for future improvements given investment casting and CNC Mill/Lathe as process options. Then, we created more engineerings drawings that documented the changes we suggested for each part for future iterations. These new models and drawings were created using SolidWorks.
