## Project Overview
This project focused on designing and constructing an original architectural model using LEGO elements. It involved developing a configuration generator to explore design variations, followed by extensive assembly to bring the final concept to life. All work was done on the Onshape CAD platform.

## Lego Configuration Generator
The creation of the configuration generator allowed for ease and simplicity of assembly. Changing the settings made it possible to create LEGO bricks of any size as needed.

## The Robot Building-CAD Modeling
I chose to design a hypothetical LEGO architecture set inspired by the Bank of Asia in Bangkok, Thailand---affectionately known as *The Robot Building*. The structure appealed to me because of its unique shape and fun appearance.

After developing an assembly plan (included in the complete documentation), I opened an Assembly Studio in Onshape and began construction. Using the configuration generator, I inserted the required pieces and sourced any special, non-rectangular elements from a provided database. I especially enjoyed this project as it allowed me to merge structured engineering design with creativity---bringing my inner child to life.
