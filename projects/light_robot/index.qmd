## Key aspects of the project

* **Circuit Design**: Assembled and tested circuits using resistors, capacitors, voltage sources (battery), DC motors, and a breadboard.

* **Embedded Systems & Control Logic**: Programmed an Arduino and used a finite state machine to control the robot’s behavior.

* **Mechanical Problem Solving**: Diagnosed and resolved wheel slippage by adding rubber bands for traction, improving mobility and performance.
